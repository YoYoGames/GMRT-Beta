## WebGPU GML API

***EXPERIMENTAL - This api experimental and therefore very likely to change over time and we will not be making any efforts to maintain any backwards compatibility between versions of the feature***

The webgpu api is an experimental api which allows developers to construct and use their own custom render pipelines using gml from within GMRT.

The API is based on the [WebGPU Javascript  API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API) which allows developers to construct and use pipelines for the WebGPU.

We have provided a [sample GameMaker project](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GMRT-Beta/tree/main/samples/WebGPU_Samples) based on the [WebGPU Samples](https://webgpu.github.io/webgpu-samples/)
and some [basic documentation](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GMRT-Beta/blob/main/docs/webgpu/WebGPUBindingsForGML.md) on the API.

Note: Since this is an experimental feature, we have not yet provided any code completion or code syntax highlighting for the newly added functions. These will be added at a later point should this experimental project move into an alpha phase.

We'd love to hear your feedback on this, in particular any issues you may have.
