## Security

YoYo Games takes the security of our software products and services seriously.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any GameMaker product, service, or repository, please report it to us!

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please either use the [Opera Public Bug Bounty](https://bugcrowd.com/opera) if the issue is in scope for a reward or submit a [GameMaker Helpdesk Ticket](https://contact.gamemaker.io/contact-us).
